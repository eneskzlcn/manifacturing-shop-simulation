**The problem definition:**
A machine tool in a manufacturing shop is turning out parts at the 
rate of every 5 minutes. As they are finished, the parts are sent to an 
inspector who takes 6Â±4 minutes (uniform distribution) to examine each 
one and rejects about 10% of the parts as faulty. You are asked to run 
the simulation for 100 faulty parts to leave the system. Gather the 
statistics about average and maximum queue lengths.

Mehmet Vakif University.

### **To Run The Program**

- If you have make and go 1.17 available in your system just run the command to compile
and run the program;
``` bash
make run
```
- If you have docker available on your system you can simply run the command to compile
and run.
```bash
docker run eneskzlcn/manifacturing-shop-simulation:latest
```
- Or you can build the image stands on project directory yourself and use it. Suppose that your
terminal on the project's working directory;
```bash
docker build -t manifacturing-shop-simulation:latest
docker run manifacturing-shop-simulation:latest
```
