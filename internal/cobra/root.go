	Long: `
A machine tool in a manufacturing shop is turning out parts at the 
rate of every x minutes. As they are finished, the parts are sent to an 
inspector who takes at most y, at least z minutes (uniform distribution) to examine each 
one and rejects about d% of the parts as faulty. You are asked to run 
the simulation for m faulty parts to leave the system. Gather the 
statistics about average and maximum queue lengths.

Constraints: 
5 <= x <= 10, 
4<= y <= 8, 
1< =z < y,
20 <= d <= 90, 
100 <= m <= 500`,
